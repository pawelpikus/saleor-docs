Delete a webhook. Before the deletion, the webhook is deactivated to pause any deliveries that are already scheduled. The deletion might fail if delivery is in progress. In such a case, the webhook is not deleted but remains deactivated.

Requires one of the following permissions: MANAGE_APPS, AUTHENTICATED_APP.

```graphql
type WebhookDelete {
  webhookErrors: [WebhookError!]!
  errors: [WebhookError!]!
  webhook: Webhook
}
```
