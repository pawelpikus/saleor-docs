Completes the checkout. As a result a new order is created. The mutation allows to create the unpaid order when setting `orderSettings.allowUnpaidOrders` for given `Channel` is set to `true`. When `orderSettings.allowUnpaidOrders` is set to `false`, checkout can be completed only when attached `Payment`/`TransactionItem`s fully cover the checkout's total. When processing the checkout with `Payment`, in case of required additional confirmation step like 3D secure, the `confirmationNeeded` flag will be set to True and no order will be created until payment is confirmed with second call of this mutation.

Triggers the following webhook events:

- SHIPPING_LIST_METHODS_FOR_CHECKOUT (sync): Optionally triggered when cached external shipping methods are invalid.
- CHECKOUT_FILTER_SHIPPING_METHODS (sync): Optionally triggered when cached filtered shipping methods are invalid.
- CHECKOUT_CALCULATE_TAXES (sync): Optionally triggered when checkout prices are expired.
- ORDER_CREATED (async): Triggered when order is created.
- NOTIFY_USER (async): A notification for order placement.
- NOTIFY_USER (async): A staff notification for order placement.
- ORDER_UPDATED (async): Triggered when order received the update after placement.
- ORDER_PAID (async): Triggered when newly created order is paid.
- ORDER_FULLY_PAID (async): Triggered when newly created order is fully paid.
- ORDER_CONFIRMED (async): Optionally triggered when newly created order are automatically marked as confirmed.
