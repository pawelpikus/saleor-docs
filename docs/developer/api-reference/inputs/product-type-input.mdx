### Fields

#### [`name`](#) ([`String`](../../../developer/api-reference/scalars/string))

Name of the product type.

#### [`slug`](#) ([`String`](../../../developer/api-reference/scalars/string))

Product type slug.

#### [`kind`](#) ([`ProductTypeKindEnum`](../../../developer/api-reference/enums/product-type-kind-enum))

The product type kind.

#### [`hasVariants`](#) ([`Boolean`](../../../developer/api-reference/scalars/boolean))

Determines if product of this type has multiple variants. This option mainly simplifies product management in the dashboard. There is always at least one variant created under the hood.

#### [`productAttributes`](#) ([`[ID!]`](../../../developer/api-reference/scalars/id))

List of attributes shared among all product variants.

#### [`variantAttributes`](#) ([`[ID!]`](../../../developer/api-reference/scalars/id))

List of attributes used to distinguish between different variants of a product.

#### [`isShippingRequired`](#) ([`Boolean`](../../../developer/api-reference/scalars/boolean))

Determines if shipping is required for products of this variant.

#### [`isDigital`](#) ([`Boolean`](../../../developer/api-reference/scalars/boolean))

Determines if products are digital.

#### [`weight`](#) ([`WeightScalar`](../../../developer/api-reference/scalars/weight-scalar))

Weight of the ProductType items.

#### [`taxCode`](#) ([`String`](../../../developer/api-reference/scalars/string))

Tax rate for enabled tax gateway.

DEPRECATED: this field will be removed in Saleor 4.0.. Use tax classes to control the tax calculation for a product type. If taxCode is provided, Saleor will try to find a tax class with given code (codes are stored in metadata) and assign it. If no tax class is found, it would be created and assigned.

#### [`taxClass`](#) ([`ID`](../../../developer/api-reference/scalars/id))

ID of a tax class to assign to this product type. All products of this product type would use this tax class, unless it's overridden in the `Product` type.
