Determine a current authorize status for order.

    We treat the order as fully authorized when the sum of authorized and charged funds
    cover the `order.total`-`order.totalGrantedRefund`.
    We treat the order as partially authorized when the sum of authorized and charged
    funds covers only part of the `order.total`-`order.totalGrantedRefund`.
    We treat the order as not authorized when the sum of authorized and charged funds is
    0.

    NONE - the funds are not authorized
    PARTIAL - the funds that are authorized and charged don't cover fully the
    `order.total`-`order.totalGrantedRefund`
    FULL - the funds that are authorized and charged fully cover the
    `order.total`-`order.totalGrantedRefund`

```graphql
enum OrderAuthorizeStatusEnum {
  NONE
  PARTIAL
  FULL
}
```
