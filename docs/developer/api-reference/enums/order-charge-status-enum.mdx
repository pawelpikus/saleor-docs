Determine the current charge status for the order.

    An order is considered overcharged when the sum of the
    transactionItem's charge amounts exceeds the value of
    `order.total` - `order.totalGrantedRefund`.
    If the sum of the transactionItem's charge amounts equals
    `order.total` - `order.totalGrantedRefund`, we consider the order to be fully
    charged.
    If the sum of the transactionItem's charge amounts covers a part of the
    `order.total` - `order.totalGrantedRefund`, we treat the order as partially charged.

    NONE - the funds are not charged.
    PARTIAL - the funds that are charged don't cover the
    `order.total`-`order.totalGrantedRefund`
    FULL - the funds that are charged fully cover the
    `order.total`-`order.totalGrantedRefund`
    OVERCHARGED - the charged funds are bigger than the
    `order.total`-`order.totalGrantedRefund`
