Determine the current charge status for the checkout.

    The checkout is considered overcharged when the sum of the transactionItem's charge
    amounts exceeds the value of `checkout.total`.
    If the sum of the transactionItem's charge amounts equals
    `checkout.total`, we consider the checkout to be fully charged.
    If the sum of the transactionItem's charge amounts covers a part of the
    `checkout.total`, we treat the checkout as partially charged.


    NONE - the funds are not charged.
    PARTIAL - the funds that are charged don't cover the checkout's total
    FULL - the funds that are charged fully cover the checkout's total
    OVERCHARGED - the charged funds are bigger than checkout's total

```graphql
enum CheckoutChargeStatusEnum {
  NONE
  PARTIAL
  FULL
  OVERCHARGED
}
```
